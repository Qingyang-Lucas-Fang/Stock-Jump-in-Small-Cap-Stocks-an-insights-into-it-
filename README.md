# Stock-Jump-in-Small-Cap-Stocks (an-insights-into-it)
The stock jump in amll cap stocks is really a blank space in quant researching and many trader and strategists view the small cap stock trading has highly risky because jumps just happen randomly due to the fact that those stocks have really low valumes and any trade related to it will cause a high percentage change in stock price(which is jump)
The stock jump is also caused by many other factors like bid-ask-spread, which i will idscuss later.
# Our work
I believe that the jump size and the jump frequency does not following a normal distribution or a Laplace Distribution even if we count in volatility terms, meaning that if we countin tiny jump, it is still not normal or laplace distribution. It follows a distribution, called Double Pareto-Lognormal (dPlN). This distribution correctly address many features or jump diffusion in small cap stocks, which includes having a long tail and the shape of it.
I will develop a mathematically rigorous framework for forecasting short-horizon price jumps in small-cap stocks. Modeling jumps as a state-dependent point process embedded in a jump-diffusion price system, we link jump arrival intensity to observable liquidity and market microstructure variables. We derive exact jump probabilities, construct likelihood-based estimators, and provide an extensible framework incorporating both Poisson and self-exciting jump dynamics. The model supports out-of-sample probability forecasting over short horizons and integrates naturally with modern machine learning for feature representation.
